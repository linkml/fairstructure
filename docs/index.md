Create a data dictionary / schema for your data using simple spreadsheets - no coding required.

## About

1. Author your schema as a google sheet or excel spreadsheet
2. [Generate schemas](https://linkml.io/linkml/generators/index.html):
    - LinkML
    - SHACL and ShEx
    - JSON-Schema
    - SQL DDL
    - OWL
3. Get tooling for free:
    - Data validators
    - Python bindings
    - Create a website for your schema

## Examples

See the [test google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wVoaiFg47aT9YWNeRfTZ8tYHN8s8PAuDx5i2HUcDpvQ/edit#gid=55566104) for examples

See also the examples folder which has an end-to-end example

## Audience

This tool is aimed at data modelers, curators, wrangers, and creators
of standards and datamodels. It is aimed at people who prefer to
develop these standards using spreadsheet tools over more
developer-centric tooling.

Using schemasheets you can develop your standard using google sheets,
excel or any other table-editing tool. A variety of tooling is
constructed automatically from this, no coding required.

## Future Developments

We hope to soon harden parts of the toolchain, and also add more
features that make it easier for non-technical people to use, include:

- Web based tooling for managing schemas
- Integration of existing LinkML tools, such as automated schema inference and mapping
