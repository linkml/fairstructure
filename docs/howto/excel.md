# Working with Excel spreadsheets

Currently no direct support, it is up to you to load/save as individual TSVs

## Tips

- schemasheets will not catch errors introduced by Excel, including
   - gene names turned into dates
- be sure to save as TSV, tabs are the default deliminter in schemasheets
- avoid using non UTF-8 characters
- avoid using color, font, etc
