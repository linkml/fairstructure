Ecosystem is in position 1/5 in a GOLD path.	https://microbiomedata/schema					gold_path_field		The abiotic factors play a profound role on the type and composition of organisms in a given environment. The GOLD Ecosystem at the top of the five-level classification system is aimed at capturing the broader environment from which an organism or environmental sample is collected. The three broad groups under Ecosystem are Environmental, Host-associated, and Engineered. They represent samples collected from a natural environment or from another organism or from engineered environments like bioreactors respectively.		https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/help									
	ecosystem_category	Ecosystem categories represent divisions within the ecosystem based on specific characteristics of the environment from where an organism or sample is isolated. Ecosystem category is in position 2/5 in a GOLD path.	https://microbiomedata/schema					gold_path_field		The Environmental ecosystem (for example) is divided into Air, Aquatic and Terrestrial. Ecosystem categories for Host-associated samples can be individual hosts or phyla and for engineered samples it may be manipulated environments like bioreactors, solid waste etc.		https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/help									
	ecosystem_subtype	Ecosystem subtypes represent further subdivision of Ecosystem types into more distinct subtypes. Ecosystem subtype is in position 4/5 in a GOLD path.	https://microbiomedata/schema					gold_path_field		Ecosystem Type Marine (Environmental -> Aquatic -> Marine) is further divided (for example) into Intertidal zone, Coastal, Pelagic, Intertidal zone etc. in the Ecosystem subtype category.		https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/help

These common characteristics based grouping is still broad but specific to the characteristics of a given environment. Ecosystem type is in position 3/5 in a GOLD path.	https://microbiomedata/schema					gold_path_field		The Aquatic ecosystem category (for example) may have ecosystem types like Marine or Thermal springs etc. Ecosystem category Air may have Indoor air or Outdoor air as different Ecosystem Types. In the case of Host-associated samples, ecosystem type can represent Respiratory system, Digestive system, Roots etc.		https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/help
