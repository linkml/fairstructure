    comments:
    - The abiotic factors play a profound role on the type and composition of organisms
      in a given environment. The GOLD Ecosystem at the top of the five-level classification
      system is aimed at capturing the broader environment from which an organism
      or environmental sample is collected. The three broad groups under Ecosystem
      are Environmental, Host-associated, and Engineered. They represent samples collected
      from a natural environment or from another organism or from engineered environments
      like bioreactors respectively.

    comments:
    - The Environmental ecosystem (for example) is divided into Air, Aquatic and Terrestrial.
      Ecosystem categories for Host-associated samples can be individual hosts or
      phyla and for engineered samples it may be manipulated environments like bioreactors,

    comments:
    - The Aquatic ecosystem category (for example) may have ecosystem types like Marine
      or Thermal springs etc. Ecosystem category Air may have Indoor air or Outdoor
      air as different Ecosystem Types. In the case of Host-associated samples, ecosystem
      type can represent Respiratory system, Digestive system, Roots etc.
